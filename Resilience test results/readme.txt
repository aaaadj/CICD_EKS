I have synchronized the Resilience and Performance tests, using the lightweight Chaoskube to randomly kill one node every minute. In the performance test results, you can observe periods of high load lasting several minutes, during which the nodes were able to recover well (there are 4 nodes in total, and theoretically, if recovery fails, the service would be unavailable after 4 minutes). Additionally, the average response time remained at a good 200ms, with an error rate of only one in a million. Therefore, I am only providing a few screenshots of the Chaoskube operation here.
